Ideal Proficiencies: Basic soldering and electromechanical prototyping, programming (Python and/or C/C++, some Java or other app-making experience), wireless communication

Baseline objective: Implement wireless interface for use with stance detection insole (and fabricate a basic insole setup). Set up a single board computer or MCU (e.g. RPi4, RPi Zero W, Arduino UNO) to receive signal and utilize it in a simple program.

Intermediate objective: Prior objective, plus bilateral insole system using wireless interface for both insoles' signal communication

Advanced objective: Prior objective(s) plus creation of an app for real time transmission, reading, recording of data from insoles. Attention should be paid to reliability and user experience, both for use by academic research teams and potential clinical deployment for easy data collection by clinicians.
