Ideal Proficiencies: Basic mechatronics, biomechanics, programming, signal processing

Baseline objective: Use FSR insoles to measure gait symmetry and associated software. Create a file stored locally with metrics. Idea is that a clinician could have someone take the system home and wear it for a few hours a day, then analyze it at the next appt. Build a housing to hold uc, batteries, and sensors that is comfortable and works for different shoe sizes. If the group is more mechanically inclined, maybe work on ways to make the FSR insole more robust/last longer.

Intermediate objective: Add an IMU to detect additional gait characteristics. Might be possible to just integrate to get step length. Probably lots of options they could try.

Advanced objective: Build on the earlier metrics to create a dashboard. Easy option is webserver and HTML. Flashier options would be on a mobile app or something that pushes data real time. Could also look at making the metrics measured in the medium objective more reliable/filtering.
