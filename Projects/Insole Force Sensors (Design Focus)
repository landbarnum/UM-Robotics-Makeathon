Ideal Proficiencies: Electromechanical prototyping, signal processing, basic programming

Baseline objective: Implement a system that can detect each phase of the gait cycle. The sensors should be able to fit within a shoe.

Intermediate objective: Design a system that can give accurate force measurements through the various phases of a gait cycle. The sensor should fit within a shoe.

Advanced objective: Create an insole sensor that can make accurate normal and/or shear force measurements through a gait cycle. The sensor should fit within a shoe.
